        Welcome to Baboclap! We are a family-owned business here to help you on your real estate journey. We run Airbnb and long-term rental properties. We hope to share what we have learned with you so that you may benefit and become prepared to overcome the challenges of being a real estate investor.
        We are based in Texas, but we hope to help all those who are investing all around the nation. We aim to connect people with a community of real estate investors in which they can develop skills and become masters of the market. 
        We wish you the best of luck on your journey, and we hope our resources that we provide here are able to help you improve and grow as a real estate investor. If you have any questions for us feel free to reach out from our contact us section below!

      <h3>Form</h3>
      <p>
        We know it is not easy at all to get going in real estate investing, so part of our purpose is to also help connect you with others who are trying to do the same thing you are. It is a lot easier when you learn together with others who are at your same level.
        How do we do this? We have created a form that asks you a few questions about your background and experience in real estate so that we can give you the appropriate courses from the program that we learned from. As you fill it out be prepared to learn new things and take new approaches in your investing.
