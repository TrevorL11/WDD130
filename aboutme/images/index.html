    <p>I'm a computer science major, I have no idea what I wanna do for a career yet, I hope to have a better idea after this semester. I don't really know much of what my different options are and I think this class and other classes I'm taking will help me out.</p>
    <p>I enjoy eating burgers, playing guitar, singing, making music, dancing, hiking, learning Spanish, and playing video games</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as long as I can remember, maybe longer. I served in the Utah Salt-Lake City West mission Spanish-speaking from 2020-2022. I love the scripture in D&C 121:41 "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;" It always encourages me to be humble and kind and patient, just like Jesus Christ is.</p>
